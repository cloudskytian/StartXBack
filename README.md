# Start X Back

A universal crack for StartIsBack and StartAllBack which should support all versions (for Windows 10 and up).

Note:

After an update you must delete `StartAllBackX64.bak` and reapply the crack. Due to this, it's recommended to disable automatic updates and update manually.

The about page will report "SIGNATURE CHECK FAILED" for StartIsBack, ignore it - it does not affect activation.

However, if it irks you, generate a self signed codesigning certificate and add it to your Trusted Root CA. Then sign the patched DLLs, and then it will report "Your license is activated".

Alternatively, place version.dll from releases into the same directory as StartIsBackCfg.exe and then it will report "Your license is activated".

Source code for version.dll is provided under StartIsGenuine.

Please support the developer of this software if you can.
